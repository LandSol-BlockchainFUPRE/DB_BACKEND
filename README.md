Tarra is a robust Django-based platform designed for secure digital signing and verification of property-related documents and transactions. It aims to bring transparency, immutability, and efficiency to property management by leveraging modern cryptographic techniques and preparing for potential blockchain integration.

## Core Features

*   **User Management & Enhanced Profiles**: Secure user registration with detailed profiles including identity verification (ID scans, biometrics hash).
*   **Property Registry**: Comprehensive property information management (type, address, owner, unique identifiers, GPS, survey plan hash).
*   **Secure Document Handling**: Upload, storage, and hashing (SHA-256) of legal documents (Sale Agreements, Title Deeds, etc.) related to properties.
*   **Transaction Lifecycle Management**: Track property transactions (sale, transfer) from pending to completed, including price, parties involved, and status.
*   **Digital Signatures**: Securely record digital signatures for documents, including the signature value, signer's public key, and document hash at the time of signing.
*   **Blockchain-Ready**: Fields for blockchain transaction hashes, block numbers, and wallet addresses, paving the way for integration with distributed ledger technologies.
*   **RESTful API**: A comprehensive API built with Django REST Framework for all functionalities, documented with Swagger/OpenAPI.
*   **File Management**: Secure handling of uploaded ID documents and property proofs.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend**: Python, Django, Django REST Framework
*   **Database**: (Configurable - e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
*   **API Documentation**: `drf-yasg` (Swagger UI & ReDoc)
*   **Authentication**: Django REST Framework Token Authentication
*   **File Storage**: Django's default file storage (configurable for cloud storage like S3)

## Prerequisites

*   Python (3.8+ recommended)
*   Pip (Python package installer)
*   Virtualenv (or any other virtual environment tool like `venv` or `conda`)
*   Git
*   A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tarra.git
cd tarra
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Using virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Setup `requirements.txt` file with necessary packages. Based on the code structure :

```
# requirements.txt
dj-database-url==2.2.0
django==4.2.16
psycopg2-binary==2.9.10
gunicorn==23.0.0
wheel==0.44.0
whitenoise==6.7.0
requests==2.32.3
django-countries==7.5.1
pillow==10.3.0
babel==2.14.0
boto3==1.35.46
django-storages==1.14.4
drf-yasg==1.21.8
djangorestframework==3.15.2
django-rest-swagger==2.2.0
django-phonenumber-field[phonenumbers]==7.3.0
```

Then install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (where `manage.py` is located) to store your environment variables. **Do not commit `.env` to version control.**

Create a `.env.example` file to show what variables are needed:

```
# .env.example
SECRET_KEY='your_django_secret_key_here'
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname' # Or your DB connection string
ALLOWED_HOSTS='127.0.0.1,localhost'

# For File Uploads (adjust as needed)
MEDIA_URL='/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT='mediafiles' # A directory in your project root, or an absolute path

# Optional: CORS configuration if your frontend is on a different domain
# CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS='http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000'
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your actual values.

### 5. Set up the Database

Ensure your database server is running and accessible with the credentials in your `.env` file.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations api_APP 
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create a Superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### 2. Access API Documentation

*   **Swagger UI**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/`
*   **ReDoc**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/`

## API Endpoints Overview

The system provides RESTful API endpoints for managing:

*   **Authentication**:
    *   `POST /auth/login/`: User login (example from prompt, adapt actual URL).
    *   (You'll likely add registration, logout, password reset, etc.)
*   **User Profiles**: `/api/user-profiles/`
    *   `GET, POST /api/user-profiles/`
    *   `GET, PUT, DELETE /api/user-profiles/<user_id>/`
*   **Properties**: `/api/properties/`
    *   `GET, POST /api/properties/`
    *   `GET, PUT, DELETE /api/properties/<property_uuid>/`
*   **Documents**: `/api/documents/`
    *   `GET, POST /api/documents/` (supports `?property_id=<uuid>` filter)
    *   `GET, PUT, DELETE /api/documents/<document_uuid>/`
*   **Transactions**: `/api/transactions/`
    *   `GET, POST /api/transactions/`
    *   `GET, PUT, DELETE /api/transactions/<transaction_uuid>/`
*   **Digital Signatures**: `/api/digital-signatures/`
    *   `GET, POST /api/digital-signatures/` (supports `?document_id=<uuid>` filter)
    *   `GET, PUT, DELETE /api/digital-signatures/<signature_uuid>/` (Note: PUT/DELETE highly restricted)

Refer to the Swagger/ReDoc documentation for detailed request/response schemas and parameters.

## Running Tests

```bash
python manage.py test api_APP
```

## Deployment

(This section would describe how to deploy the application to a production environment, e.g., using Docker, Gunicorn, Nginx, Heroku, AWS, etc. Add details once you have a deployment strategy.)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3.  Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure your code adheres to project coding standards and includes tests for new features.

**To make this README fully functional for your project:**

1.  **Replace `yourusername`** in the clone URL and badge URLs with your actual GitHub username.
2.  **Replace `api_APP`** with the actual name of your Django app (e.g., `property_system`, `core`).
3.  **Create `requirements.txt`**: Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your activated virtual environment after installing all necessary packages.
4.  **Create `.env.example`**: As shown above, populate it with the variables your application needs.
5.  **Create a `LICENSE` file**: If you choose MIT, copy the MIT license text into a file named `LICENSE` in your project root.
6.  **File Uploads**: Ensure `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` are correctly configured in your Django `settings.py` (ideally loaded from environment variables) and that the `MEDIA_ROOT` directory exists and is writable by the Django process. For production, you'd typically serve media files separately (e.g., via Nginx or a CDN).
7.  **Badges**: Set up CI/CD (like GitHub Actions, Travis CI) to get live build status and code coverage badges.

This README gives new users and contributors a good understanding of your Tarra project.
